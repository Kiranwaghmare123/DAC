I am from mechanical i know i would get less call than electrical or CS IT. Then what is the reason of wasting money.  At least CDAC have to work on this at least get good chance to seat. In mechanical engineering we have JAVA in 5Th sem as practical dot net also. I knew codings. Worked on catia like software. At least we get a chance to seat in companies interview.

The first reason is slow recruitment by companies.

Second, I had another option at that time to do a self-sponsored MTech in NITS. I prefer MTech because, due to low recruitment by companies, after doing the PG Diploma course I became unsure what I would do next if I was not selected. There is no guarantee of getting a job in MTech either, but there are opportunities for further studies and other fields. So I prefer doing MTech instead of doing a PG Diploma course."

rishiatole4545@gmail.com,Aug-24,"
Not showing placement data and the fact that all CDAC centers do not provide the same level of training and the placements chances given to each student are also reduced. If CDAC is charging such high fees just to teach programming languages, it should guarantee placements for the students. I’m placed in a mid-sized software organization where two candidates from CDAC have joined as Trainee Software Engineers like me. I wonder what the point is of paying such hefty fees only to secure a job with a salary of 3 LPA. I completed my graduation in May 2024, but those two candidates graduated in 2022—one from CDAC Nashik and the other from MET Bandra. If CDAC cannot provide placements, it should consider shutting down, as it was established to provide knowledge and placements in the software industry, to the best of my knowledge."

Furthermore, while I am satisfied with my rank, I was hoping to secure admission to the DAC course at CDAC Acts or CDAC VITA, which are well-known for their excellent reputation.

patilpranav943@gmail.com,Sep-23,"Before joining CDAC, I did not have an IT background. However, after completing the full-time CDAC course, I am now qualified as an IT professional. During the placement process, however, it seems that not all students are evaluated on the same criteria, which is attributed to the companies’ specific requirements. I believe it is essential for the CDAC team to actively engage with companies and ensure they understand that all CDAC graduates are qualified IT professionals. This effort would better represent the true value of CDAC certification to employers and help align opportunities for all students.

Additionally, while the recession has indeed slowed down placements, many students still enroll in CDAC during these challenging times, trusting in CDAC’s support for their career growth. In these times especially, it is crucial for CDAC to place a stronger focus on placements rather than emphasizing the economic challenges. During better economic periods, placement rates are high and students are placed with relative ease. My concern is that, during tough times, CDAC should stand by its students and work to secure placements for them."

anandskul007@gmail.com,Mar-23,"Dear C-DAC Administration,

I am reaching out with a heavy heart and deep frustration to provide feedback on my experience as a student in the March-September 2023 batch. I came to C-DAC with high hopes, having made sacrifices and taken risks to join this program. Like many in my batch, I believed C-DAC would be my gateway to a brighter career in software development. But the reality has been starkly different – and profoundly disappointing.

1. Broken Promises and Lost Opportunities:
For many of us, enrolling in C-DAC was not a casual decision. Some left stable jobs, uprooted their lives, and invested hard-earned money with the expectation that C-DAC’s reputation and support would pave the way toward fulfilling software careers. Instead, we found ourselves neglected and disillusioned. The promise of ample interview opportunities was nothing but words, leaving us in a worse position than before – jobless, with months of effort and resources seemingly wasted.

2. An Unfulfilled Commitment to Practical Skill-Building:
C-DAC was supposed to equip us with hands-on experience that would make us industry-ready. Unfortunately, the training we received fell short. We worked hard, hoping that C-DAC’s curriculum would provide us with skills that were current, practical, and valued by employers. But the practical knowledge that was supposed to be the hallmark of this program was lacking, and, without proper guidance or exposure, many of us feel unprepared and unsupported.

3. Silence and Lack of Transparency – Feeling Abandoned:
Perhaps the most painful aspect has been the lack of communication and transparency. We were left in the dark, with no clear guidance or updates on placements. Every day without communication felt like a new blow to our morale, as our belief in C-DAC and its mission eroded. When we needed reassurance or clarity, we were met with silence, leaving us with only anxiety and growing doubts about our future.

4. A Word to Future Students:
To those considering C-DAC, I urge you to look carefully at the reality beyond the promises. In hindsight, private institutes offer a much more supportive environment, where students are not just numbers but individuals with dreams and aspirations that deserve attention. Do not make the mistake we made. Choose a place where you are respected, supported, and actually connected to real job opportunities.

C-DAC once stood as a prestigious institution that launched countless careers. But for us, it has become a painful memory of missed opportunities, lost time, and broken promises. We put our trust, our futures, and our lives into this program, and we feel utterly let down. I hope you take this feedback seriously, not just as a complaint, but as a call to action to restore the dignity, value, and future of this institution – for the sake of every student who follows in our steps.

I am writing to request your understanding regarding my absence from the CCPP exam scheduled on 7th November 2024 Company name (Arshil) . I misunderstood the dates due to seeing the opt-out window on the PMS portal as open  9th October 2024, which led me to misunderstand date.

I apologize for this oversight and am eager to resolve the situation. If possible, I would appreciate any guidance on how I might complete this requirement to regain eligibility for CCPP.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding.

The main issue with CDAC-ACTS is that while their teaching is very good, they don't focus on preparing students for interviews. Specifically, they don't teach how to answer interview questions effectively. I believe that at least 2-3 mock technical interviews should be conducted before the actual placement process begins."

vishal.b4646@gmail.com,Mar-23,Taken feedback about placement and found that many of the placement gets taken place basis of luck specially shortlist this leads to lay offs after placement. Capable students doesn't get appropriate package and undeserving students get placements. CDAC should take initiative to highlight their top performing students to the recruiter first.According to the performance of 6 months CDAC should shortlist candidates first and forward to the recruiter without any branch restrictions at initial days later on can give chance to everyone. This can also lead to the good feedback for companies that we get minimal shortlist and quality resources from CDAC. This is genuine feedback received from one of the recruiter to me . Shortlisting of 1000 of students doesn't help them to find out best among them cause result to not repeating companies. This approach was suitable for bulk hiring but time changed this won't work for companies as well as students.

1. At the time of admission as well as the at the time of course progression and ccp students are considered same but at the time of placements there arise many categories like cs-it non cs-it students, gap year students and some more, this can be acceptable from companies end there eligibility criteria may differ but CDAC PLACEMENT coordinator also differentiate among the students, at some center like bengaluru it was told by the former alumni's that coordinator itself was saying to gap year student that c dac is not responsible for your placements or during our advertisement we never promised to provide you an interview opportunity you have taken a risk by dropping years and by taking admission to cdac also , this type of clarity should be given at the time of orientation session itself and is unacceptable to students and demotivates them, why would they take a risk if market is flooded with lot of other courses with many of them comes with pay after placements schemes.

2.There are many other courses like iit madras diploma in programming and data science curriculum wise they have a better structure and self paced gamified approach. Students corelate with them more easily, their course is not at all rushed up.

3. For acts there placement data and statics are not provided officially MEDIAN SALARY IS NOT PROVIDED and for other centers they in recent years have removed the placement statics after slowdown in hiring.

4. And Not getting the expected institution for my Course.

I really wanted to join the course, and knew about the fees and also knew that it is going to hard for my parents to handle all such things financially. 
From My side as I think so, you guys can lower the fees structure for students because many of the people are personally need this course but due to financial issue they don't go for it."

phulpagarmanoj123@gmail.com,Aug-24,"Thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback.

After careful consideration, I decided not to pursue admission at CDAC due to certain economic circumstances. I am currently employed in Pune, having relocated from another city, and I am supporting my family through this job. While I am highly interested in acquiring updated, industry-oriented knowledge in Embedded Systems and VLSI technology, both of which are offered by CDAC, I am unable to take the course in its current offline format. The course requires a full-time commitment and does not allow for concurrent employment.

Given my current situation, I would like to inquire whether CDAC could consider offering a more flexible course structure—perhaps through hybrid learning or evening/weekend options—that would allow students like myself to continue working while pursuing the program. This flexibility would greatly benefit those of us who are eager to upgrade our skills but cannot afford to quit our jobs due to financial responsibilities.
I sincerely appreciate your understanding and would be grateful for any guidance or suggestions you may have regarding this matter.

I greatly value the work that CDAC does, and my decision was based solely on my unique circumstances. I will be happy to provide further details through the feedback form as requested.

Thank you once again, and I wish CDAC continued success in its mission to educate and empower future professionals."

ankittayde2@gmail.com,Mar-23,"Hello, I have done CDAC on March 2023 batch but not got placement from them , only I got 8 calls  after then I managed a job by myself so the conclusion is that CDAC have to work on their placement although is of less package that also acceptable because students are spending lot of money on doing CDAC

I did scored good but as there are limited offline seats for Pune CDAC AI course I am not sure whether I will be selected or not because many students are opting out of it in some time so seats are vacant!"
ninaadbagul96@gmail.com,Sep-23,"I completed my course from Sunbeam Infotech as part of the September 2023 batch, but I haven’t been placed yet. I strongly believe that C-DAC should extend more support to its students, especially during challenging times like recessions in the IT industry. Additionally, all centers should consider reducing their intake across courses to ensure better placement opportunities for students. This is my clear and constructive opinion, and I urge you to take it into consideration.

ghadgegajanan77@gmail.com,Mar-23,"Did not get C-DAC Kharghar as it was also my Exam centre. I got A+B+C rank 8900 something and A+B+C rank don't know. I live in Kalyan got Online PG-DRAT Kolkata don't know placements and high fees and CDAC Mohali, Thiruvananthpiram, silchar were too far away. Cdac was a means to get into IT Sector that too from mechanical   branch and a way to graduate hiding my gap year and drop year by getting placed."
punyeshranjit@gmail.com,Mar-24,"Generally students visit public platforms like Youtube or Telegram for getting suggestions on preference of centers list to be filled for online application  , where they come across many negative feedbacks about certain centers according to the education quality provided and previous years placement percentages . This may divert student's mind to opt out from admission process and try again for next CCAT exam to probably get admission in certain top performing centers."
shindeaniket278@gmail.com,Sep-23,low placement.. low rank
pawansharma6892@gmail.com,Aug-24,"I passed out in 2014 and had only one year working experience ,therefore I realised due to my big career gap it will be difficult to grab a job in IT sector even if I had done course from the cdac acts. Hence I decided to not join, if you can throw insights on my issue of career gap then it will be helpful for me to decide whether I should join cdac or not. Thanks"

adityakatre1544@gmail.com,Sep-23,As I heard company came with 400 vacancies and only 150 got placed. And it is happening in every batch.so could you please tell what action you have taken to improve placement. Isn't it your fault to if student knowledge is not up to mark as company want. Students are coming there to get industry by spending around 2 lakh plus amount. You should think on it.
