Arrange some technical mock interviews for preparation.",They are offering very less package.,No,Good,"Yes. I can guide the students on how they should prepare, on what areas they need to focus.

None of my colleagues were asked questions in java till now. ,This year DBDA had less no of companies. Nearly 25 days gap was there in which there were no companies.,Smooth Process,Satisfactory,If I can I'll support in whatever way CDAC wants me to. Like alumini interaction etc,"Honestly the no of input in terms of admissions/students which CDAC takes is pretty high compared to the demand/job openings in market. CDAC says that it's a training institute not a placement institute, but who wants to just gain knowledge and not get placed. If the no of admissions are reduced only the students who are really passionate about IT will apply and it will be par the market requirements "

My experience suggests that they may not consistently meet basic educational standards and seem to rely heavily on social media promotion. It could be beneficial for C-DAC to focus on enhancing the teaching capabilities of its faculty to align with recognized standards. Regularly sharing class recordings online for public feedback could also foster transparency and improvement. Your faculties lack even basic teaching abilities(Please review Saruti Gupta recent classes videos of FoAI. Maths class lack any connection to AI despite we are here to learn Maths for AI. When I raised this concern, the course coordinator, Mr. Ravi Payal, suggested that it would be addressed in the machine learning class, which I found somewhat insane comment.",No,"I believe the reputation of C-DAC may rely more on social media promotion and its association with PARAM computers than on the actual quality of education provided. After two months in the program, I have observed that the educational standards do not meet the basic requirements for technical courses. It seems that many faculty members may lack both the necessary subject knowledge and effective teaching skills.

Additionally, there are concerns that the institution may not adequately support students in securing meaningful placements. I hope C-DAC will consider enhancing its programs by bringing in industry professionals to provide instruction, which could significantly improve the overall quality of education. Thank you for considering this feedback.","C-DAC courses are well-designed and marketed; however, they often fall short in delivering on their promises. To enhance the quality of education and meet basic technical standards, I recommend that C-DAC consider employing industry experts as faculty members. This change could significantly improve the educational experience for students.","I would like to bring to your attention the recording of the course inauguration meeting, during which C-DAC invited several HR representatives from visiting companies. I recommend reviewing this meeting, as it appears that some representatives were unprepared and did not effectively represent their companies. This led to some confusion and was a source of amusement among students and even some C-DAC staff. It may be beneficial for future meetings to encourage representatives to prepare in advance, ensuring a more professional and meaningful engagement. Thank you for considering this feedback.",I am completely unhappy with the admission as I would not recommend anything except advertise clearly if a particular course id for experienced people or just freshers.  ,Unsatisfactory,"I cannot endorse C-DAC's educational system, as it appears to lack basic educational standards.

In my opinion, C-DAC has centers in nearly every state of India. I am from Uttar Pradesh, where we have C-DAC Noida. Uttar Pradesh has many colleges, but a significant number do not provide education that meets industry standards—they are primarily profit-driven, and job placements are lacking, even at salaries as low as 80k LPA. Yes, 80k LPA.

My suggestion:

1.Consider organizing workshops (1-2 days) at semi-urban colleges across states. I believe this is the most effective approach. For each workshop, an alumni from the same state should be present to connect with local students.
2.Post training-related posters on LinkedIn frequently. Yes, as often as possible.

We invested our time and money and you given us only chance to get appear not single interview call.,No,Unsatisfactory,"No, not at all, I didn't support CDAC now because we didn't got any placement offers from CDAC campus. You don't how we suffered after CDAC. We feaced many consequences after course from family and society.",Your course is good but placement is main factor which not good now a days. Pls don't play with students life. They invest there family income in your course abd after all hardwork if they didn't get any call from CDAC campus then they goes in depression and many consequences they face. So overall I suggest pls close your business or shop now until you provide good placements.

Bt it could be very good if there would be more options for online course. Very limited seats are available & not any online course in pune region. ,Yet don't hv any idea abt campus of cdac. ,Admission process is lengthy. It can be done faster. ,Satisfactory,Don't hv any idea. ,"I would like to suggest for CDAC Noida. Courses here are totally teacher oriented. Staff has many other works apart from teaching so they leave in between and students are hanging n waiting for teachers when it will be joined back. After waiting for long time they announce we will continue tomorrow further . They don't value students time. 
There is not any course schedule given for student. Unplanned holidays apart from the academic n national holidays in between the classes. Most of the time staff has network or technical issues. Teaching is good bt not any discipline.
This is not a way I expected from CDAC. Its not following standards n strategy  I heard about CDAC. "

When students see strong placement outcomes, it enhances the institute's reputation organically, attracting more attention and interest in C-DAC courses without additional marketing efforts.",No,"Previously, C-DAC’s unique selling point (USP) was its strong placement record, which set it apart from other courses. However, with declining placement support, this advantage has diminished. As of now, without guaranteed placements, students may feel that C-DAC courses no longer provide the same value for their investment.","The current C-DAC courses lack substantial value, especially given the high fees, which don't seem justified considering the quality of content. Many similar or better resources are freely available on platforms like YouTube. Unless C-DAC updates its curriculum to provide unique, in-depth knowledge and hands-on skills that aren't easily accessible online, it risks becoming irrelevant, much like many engineering colleges have.","Although companies do visit the campus, there seems to be a perception that C-DAC students may receive preferential treatment over students from authorized centers. This discrepancy can lead to frustration among students from authorized centers, as they feel they are not given an equal opportunity during placements. Addressing this issue could improve fairness and overall satisfaction across all C-DAC-affiliated centers.",No suggestion ,Good,Big No,"C-DAC should update its syllabus to align with current industry demands and concentrate heavily on placements. Many students enroll in C-DAC as a last hope to secure a job, primarily seeking reliable placement opportunities. Without delivering on this expectation, the course loses much of its appeal and purpose for these students."

10/29/2024 17:43,pranavbhosekar88@gmail.com,Sep-23,PG-DAC,AIT-YCP Mumbai,Through friend or family members,No,"I dont think the first aim of C-DAC should be to ""improve the awareness"" since placements are at all time low and almost half of the students are not getting placed. I know for a fact that many of my batchmates are not placed yet. When the number of placements improves and people can see the results, there will be no need to ""improve awareness"" as the results will speak for themselves.",Yes,The main USP is that students can be trained and deployed as software developers in a very short time. Another strength is the way of learning thats followed in C-DAC which enables the students to learn any upcoming technology in a very short amount of time using top-down approach.,"There should be more focus on problem solving and DSA as more and more companies are following this pattern of hiring used FAANG companies. In C-DAC there is no emphasis on solving leetcode and hackerrank problems which are used by many companies coming for placements. Also there should be more emphasis on creating mini full-stack projects throughout the course as some companies are asking students to demonstrate things such as creating APIs, frontend design and database design.",Companies should declare the approximate vacancy which they are going to fill in the respective placement drive directly to students.,The admission process should be more transperant. Placement statistics of last 5 year's batches should be displayed centre-wise on official admissions portal of C-DAC. It will help students to make more informed decisions about choice of centre. ,Satisfactory,"If the experience of a recently placed student is deemed useful by the C-DAC centre and the students of current batch, feel free to contact for preparing the students for interviews.","C-DAC needs to stop looking at these courses as a source of income for the time being Looking at current market conditions, C-DAC should reduce vacancies and increase C-CAT cutoff for PG Diploma courses. Students come from various socio-economic backgrounds in hopes of getting a gainful employment through this course. The fees are 1L+ for almost all courses. And when they have to go empty handed after going through one of the hardest courses, it is hard for the families to accept it. Rather than blaming students for not scoring enough in CCEE everytime anyone asks about placements, focus on improving overall approach."

11/2/2024 13:08,pranjalpandey539@gmail.com,Mar-23,PG-DAC,AIT-YCP Mumbai,Through friend or family members,No,By placing more students in reputed companies cause right now record of cdac is worst. After paying lacs people are not getting placed then what's the use of even taking exams for selection. A few companies came by in our batch and they were not even interested to take students. In people's mind cdac is a big big big scam. Please improve your placements then ask for reviews,No,Cdac comprises of multiple subjects according to industry requirement that's strength but few of your faculties don't consider it as a responsibility. They are so casually teaching like they know students are not going to be placed then what's the use of teaching them properly. Simply finish the syllabus and my job is done. ,"Yes, first focus on the subjects through which you can gurantee your students placements then focus on others instead of following syllabus blindly","It was just formality for companies. Somehow, it was very clear in there mind that some of them won't even consider students and some companies took one or two students even after alot of considerations.","Please improve your campus reputation cause when students reach your campus after appearing in CCAT. They don't think twice to get admission.it should be very clearly written in bold letters that we don't provide placements, only a few will get placed that also on the basis of their skills. Cause if I have skills then why I'll go to cdac in first place. ",Good,"Yes, I'll definitely support them by creating awareness that don't take admission in such courses which don't guarantee you placements. And if you have already took admission then solely focus on your strengths which you've already learnt. Don't focus on their curriculum because it's of no use. ","Yes, stop scamming people because students reach your campus with lot of hope and prejudice. They feel obliged that they're entering your campus through screening process.dont kill their hopes by snatching their money and once the batch is over. You don't care what they're facing. It's not the way of making money. 🙏🙏"

As it takes more time for these students to get hold of programming as CS/IT Students have experienced programming for 4 Years. And also CS/IT Students have to be preferred less because they could have done in those 4 Years but still again come for C-DAC courses. The Course Duration needs to be extended to 1 Year instead of 6 Months I honestly think because in 6 Months We learn 8 Modules with not having expertise in any one Module.

",No,A bit more practical implementation in classrooms but not upto the industry mark. Hardly we have 4 months of classes.

Why to distribute money for 4 different centres. Rather gather all 240 students at one Hall and make the best faculties available with more practical orientation. ,"No proper timelines for the exam and results. Keeping us waiting for 2-2 weeks and months sometimes, drains student in all aspects. What's promised needs to be delivered. Partially between centres while interview process should be prohibited. It breaks the moral of hard working candidates. ","Get projects done from the start especially on SQL Database, Big data techonology, Machine Learning Since Day one.

Like it happened for us. In ML, big data. ",Satisfactory,From Fresher's job perspective if somebody is unable to find a job Or any other reason - that too is getting minimized day after day ,"Overall 4 months classes are being conducted which is like nothing.

Many industry level tech professionals are already working here on live projects. Students can learn from the course curriculum and also interacting with working professionals to gain actual experience.","I'm very much satisfied with the course, so there are no suggestions.

Social media campaigns on platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn can reach students directly, while alumni stories shared locally provide real success examples. Setting up booths at career fairs and tech expos would allow students to learn more and ask questions in person. Offering free or low-cost introductory tech workshops, along with online Q&A webinars, can build interest. Scholarships for students from underserved areas can make courses more accessible, encouraging wider participation in C-DAC.",Yes,"C-DAC courses stand out due to their industry-aligned curriculum, focusing on in-demand areas like AI, data science, and cybersecurity. They emphasize practical, hands-on learning, with projects and labs that simulate real-world challenges, equipping students with practical skills.

Its strong alumni network, with graduates working at top tech companies, also supports new students in job placements. Additionally, as a government-backed institution, C-DAC holds a respected position in the tech community, making its programs affordable and reputable, offering students an excellent return on investment.","The course content is good overall, but I suggest allocating more time for advanced topics like Java and .NET. The current 20-day duration feels a bit short to cover these subjects in depth. Extending the time for these modules would allow students to grasp the concepts more thoroughly and practice effectively, ensuring a stronger understanding and better preparation for real-world applications.","The companies visiting our campus in the software development sector are of average quality. While we have some opportunities, it would be great to have more renowned software companies. These would provide students with a broader range of career options in high-growth areas. Despite this, the teachers are doing their best to prepare us. They offer comprehensive guidance, technical workshops, and mock interviews to ensure that we are well-equipped for the recruitment process and ready to succeed in the software development field.","The admission process for CDAC courses is very good, with clear procedures and helpful guidance at every step. The CDAC Delhi center is excellent, providing a supportive environment for students. The teachers at this center are highly professional, punctual, and disciplined. They make a sincere effort to guide us and ensure that we fully understand the course material. Their dedication to helping students succeed is truly commendable. Overall, both the center and the course offerings are very good, creating a positive and conducive learning atmosphere",Satisfactory,"Yes, whenever CDAC needs me, I am available to support future batches. I am willing to assist in any way I can, whether it's sharing my experiences, helping with course-related queries, or offering guidance on career development. I’m ready to contribute whenever required to ensure that future students have a smooth and successful learning experience.",The C-DAC courses are very good and cover topics that are highly relevant and used in the industry. The curriculum is well-designed to equip students with the skills needed for real-world applications. I would highly recommend everyone to pursue the 6-month PG course from CDAC as it provides excellent knowledge and practical exposure that can significantly enhance career prospects.

I had an interview with UnivLabs Technologies, which was for a Python-based role, and I was offered the position of Application Engineer. However, when I joined, most of the work was IT support-related, like connecting printers, setting up LAN connections, and providing laptops and PCs to new employees. After completing the PG-DBDA, is this the kind of role CDAC wants me to work in? At the very least, the CDAC center should cross-verify the job profiles and roles companies are offering to students. My life has been negatively impacted since CDAC; after leaving that company, I am now unemployed.",center - improve levels of every center dont focus on selected ones,Satisfactory,yes,"    Please ensure thorough verification of every job offered through each CDAC center. CDAC Delhi did not provide adequate placement support, and in my batch, only two students were placed through CDAC—myself in November and another student in February. However, the job I received did not match the profile promised. Although I was hired as an Application Engineer after a Python-based interview, the actual work involved basic IT tasks, such as connecting printers, setting up LAN connections, and onboarding new employees with laptops and PCs. Despite reaching out to my placement officer numerous times, I was repeatedly told, ""We can't help."" From day one, I was assigned IT tasks, which left me no option but to leave, and since then, I have been unemployed for nearly a year. Other students in my batch are also struggling, as CDAC Delhi ceased providing placement support after those initial two placements.

    When students pursue the CDAC DBDA course, we expect interviews relevant to DBDA roles. CDAC Delhi, however, seemed to offer any available job, even internships or unrelated roles. Please support students by providing proper placements aligned with their qualifications so that we can build meaningful careers rather than face setbacks.Please don’t put our careers at risk.and dont ruin our life"

If C-DAC truly had strong USPs, I wouldn’t still be struggling to find a job. Despite investing considerable time and my hard-earned money, the placement rates for C-DAC are not even close to those of other programs, making it difficult for students like me to secure job opportunities post-completion.","Yes, I believe C-DAC should prioritize providing comprehensive and reliable placement support for all students. In my experience at C-DAC Delhi, the program lacked consistent processes for completing the syllabus on time or conducting thorough revisions & mock interviews, leaving students underprepared. Additionally, C-DAC's placement rates are noticeably lower than other comparable programs, and the quality and verification of job placements vary across centers.

I would urge C-DAC to improve its placement services, create standard operating procedures across all centers to ensure quality, and enhance curriculum planning so that students can complete the syllabus with enough time for revision.","Sorry, but it’s almost a joke when it comes to the companies visiting C-DAC New Delhi for placements. Here’s a look at the placement experience in my batch,

Bajaj conducted a test but provided no results or feedback. Yash Technologies showed interest but then didn’t allow non-IT backgrounds, even though many of us joined C-DAC to enter IT.  NashTech Global took a test, but neither they nor the TPO followed up. Other companies came, had us fill forms, and then disappeared without feedback. 

Out of the entire batch, only two students were placed:

One was hired as a Python Developer in December 2023, though the job was more about office maintenance tasks like setting up cables and repairing monitors than data-related work. He didn’t even receive salary slips.

The second was placed in January 2024 with a promised full-time role after six months, but no updates have followed since.

Overall, there’s a clear lack of verification, support, and follow-up from both the TPO and C-DAC New Delhi management, making the placement experience feel unreliable and disappointing.","The admission process, center, and course allocation at C-DAC went smoothly, with no major hassles. The process was straightforward and well-organized, making it easy to navigate without unnecessary stress.",Unsatisfactory,"Yes, if I secure a job, I’d definitely support future C-DAC students by referring them for opportunities. Since the institute's placement support was limited, I feel it’s my responsibility as a C-DAC alumnus to help ensure that no student has to go through the frustration and discouragement I experienced.","I believe C-DAC should limit the number of institutes and focus on providing quality teaching, proper revisions, and mock interviews. It's also crucial to have a well-trained TPO and management team dedicated to supporting placements.

Honestly, I joined C-DAC with the hope of building a career in IT, based on the success stories I saw from batches up until 2022. But after completing the course, my experience has been nothing short of disappointing. My life has become more stressful and depressing because of the lack of support and opportunities, and I feel let down by C-DAC.

If possible, I would request help for me and my batchmates to find the right opportunities. If not, it might sound harsh, but I’d urge the IT Ministry or C-DAC to consider refunding our hard-earned money so we can pursue better private courses that focus on placements."

However, instead of taking responsibility for ensuring an effective placement process, the authorities often blame students for their shortcomings or performance. They need to consider the students' situations, conditions, and circumstances and work in their favor to improve the overall experience and outcomes.

IMP the college should have well known placement officer.,"Minimize the burden on students, some people required time to grasp the knowledge so please don't forced them to do certain things like making communication video etc. 
Listen students problems if majority of people saying that the teacher is teaching is not up to the mark you should take action against them, also take anonymous votings after 4 5 days of lectures.
Focus on taking mock interviews after every model because of this the self confidence of student is also increase and it helps during interview.
Many students faced difficulties in coding exams because they didn't practice the reason behind this is no brainstorming on coding  session and not understand what they are coding they just do chat gpt, so the solution is the teacher should teach coding in their free session so weak student could understand.

Also target those people who graduate earlier because they didn't get call so you should analyze them which area they are lacking and teacher should Tell them if you getting call treat like this is your last call and you should take seriously. Please dont corner them and also they need contineous attention and motivation from teachers.
So this is my suggestion and please dont waste students time by taking attendance after every lectures or in lab sessions.

",Companies only need basic understanding of codes and theory they asking questions mostly on projects and simple basic questions and also pattern coding and snippets. By taking mock after every module their confidence might be increase.,Not such.,Satisfactory,By mentoring and guiding ,If you can then increase the course length.

1. Digital Marketing: Leverage platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn to target young graduates and IT professionals with paid ads. Create YouTube videos showcasing C-DAC alumni success stories and placement opportunities. Optimize the website for keywords like “advanced computing courses in [your region]” to rank higher on search engines.

2. Collaborate with Educational Institutions: Conduct seminars and webinars in colleges to introduce C-DAC courses. Partner with universities to offer pre-CAT workshops or coding boot camps. Alumni talks can further inspire students by sharing real-world success stories.

3. Community Engagement: Participate in local tech fests, hackathons, and job fairs to highlight the relevance of C-DAC certifications. Organize free coding workshops to showcase practical applications of C-DAC skills. Advertise success stories through newspapers, radio, and regional TV.

4. Industry Partnerships: Work with local IT companies to promote C-DAC courses as a pathway to skilled employment. Collaborate on job placement drives and internships to demonstrate career benefits.",No,"C-DAC courses stand out due to their industry-oriented curriculum focused on emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and Cybersecurity.

Additionally, C-DAC offers a diverse range of programs catering to students and professionals at different career stages, making them a trusted choice for skill development.","To enhance C-DAC courses, consider adding topics like Blockchain, Web3, and Quantum Computing for industry relevance.

Strengthen placement support with internships and alumni mentorship programs. Regularly update the curriculum with industry expert input and align it with global standards like AWS or PMP. Finally, include soft skills training and customize content for regional and international job markets. These steps will ensure C-DAC remains cutting-edge and globally competitive.
",,"To improve C-DAC admissions, streamline the online portal for a user-friendly experience, ensure transparent course and center allocation based on rank and preferences, and offer pre-counseling sessions for guidance. Introduce flexible payment options like installments or scholarships and provide clear post-admission instructions for enrollment and orientation. These steps will enhance efficiency and candidate satisfaction.",Satisfactory,"Yes, I would support future C-DAC batches by offering mentorship, conducting alumni talks, providing placement referrals, contributing to study materials, and organizing technical workshops.

11/21/2024 20:51,rahulkaviya1560@gmail.com,Sep-23,PG-DAC,C-DAC Bengaluru,Through friend or family members,Yes,"I was student at Cdac Bangalore, September 2023 batch, The 1st month of the course went well. In the first month we were taught Java Data Structure, Sql Operating System but after that every technology they teach passed very fast and for non computer science engineering students it was very hard to catch upon the  knowledge of any technology. It went really fast many students I was with including me were not able to grasp everything that was taught. Many technologies like Dot net C#  were not taught well even if the faculty was very much experienced and had depth knowledge in their respective Areas. I think it is the time duration of the batch which should be reviewed  seriously so that Students with the potential to gain solid knowledge and skills and become industry ready are not affected by the time duration that these batches provide . I agree that every student has its own speed of grasping but I was ranked among the top 20 student in the CCEE exam and even than i was unable to pass the exam. Few improvement points that could bring out the change required :
 1 Student should be made Interview ready from the first day of the course rest all does not matter. 
2 Most Important:  Instead of throwing all the subjects on the students and teaching them through in such a small time let them decide which technology they want to study and then teach them all the related technologies this way student get to learn only specific technology and can do in depth for eg separate classes for Java devlopers, separate for dotnet, separate for python and mern stack only then student will get in depth knowledge and time enough to grasp all the technologies so that he has the freedom to choose in which technology he/she wants to pursue his/her career. 
3 Conduct as many as Mock tests and practice session as possible",No,If It cannot get atleast 70-80% of its students placed then there is not much strength as compared to other courses after all students join it specifically to get a job,"I already wrote it above, Please don't mind the harsh language .

Despite meeting company eligibility criteria, I noticed that placement officers, particularly Indrani ma’am, often prioritized CSE students for most opportunities, leaving non-IT students at a disadvantage. This lack of fairness was disheartening. While I eventually secured an off-campus job with an 8 LPA package, I urge C-DAC to ensure that all eligible students, regardless of their background, are given a fair chance during placements.","Companies visited the campus, but the placement officer at C-DAC Bangalore often shortlisted only CSE background students for most opportunities, even when non-CSE students met the eligibility criteria. Additionally, the placement officer was not very supportive, which created a sense of bias and unfairness during the placement process.","The C-DAC admission process is generally smooth, but improvements can be made in communication, transparency in course/center allocation, and support for students facing issues like course cancellations. These steps will enhance the overall experience.",Good,"I will always support C-DAC students. As a proud C-DACian, I am committed to helping, referring, and guiding future batches to the best of my ability.","C-DAC courses are excellent for skill development, but there is room for improvement in placement fairness and transparency. Equal opportunities should be ensured for students from all backgrounds, including non-IT. Additionally, better support and guidance from placement officers would enhance the overall experience."

11/21/2024 21:51,daminichaudhary17@gmail.com,Mar-24,PG-DBDA,C-DAC Bengaluru,C-DAC Website,No,"Interactive Information Sessions, Leverage Digital Marketing, Organize Career Guidance Events",No,"The USPs (Strengths) of C-DAC courses, when compared to other similar programs, lie in their brand recognition and the promise of industry-oriented curriculum. C-DAC is known for offering specialized post-graduate diploma courses that focus on cutting-edge technologies, catering to the needs of the tech industry.
However, the experience varies significantly depending on the center and course. For instance, while courses like DAC (Diploma in Advanced Computing) are prioritized and well-structured with good placement opportunities, others, such as DBDA (Diploma in Big Data Analytics), might not receive the same level of focus. Despite being titled as a Big Data course, DBDA sometimes leans heavily towards Machine Learning, deviating from the core Big Data technologies that students expect to learn.
Another drawback is the placement process, which is inconsistent. While C-DAC has strong connections with the tech industry, these connections don’t always extend to all programs equally. Students pursuing non-DAC courses often feel neglected in terms of placement opportunities, which undermines the potential USP of job assistance.
In summary, the strengths of C-DAC courses include their strong brand, focus on technical skills, and industry relevance in certain areas. However, there is room for improvement in maintaining consistency across courses and ensuring equitable placement support for all programs.","1. Align Course Content with Course Titles
Courses like PG Diploma in Big Data Analytics (DBDA) should strictly focus on the technologies promised, such as Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL databases, and distributed computing. If a course is marketed as “Big Data Analytics,” it should not be overloaded with Machine Learning, as it creates confusion and dissatisfaction. Introduce a clear demarcation between courses like DBDA and Data Science-related programs.

2. Improve Faculty Expertise
Invest in hiring or training faculty who are not only knowledgeable but also capable of teaching advanced and industry-relevant topics effectively. For technical courses, hands-on knowledge of tools and frameworks like Kafka, Flink, and real-world data pipelines is critical. Mediocre teaching severely undermines the credibility of the institution.

3. Update Curriculum Regularly
Technology evolves rapidly. The curriculum should be updated more frequently to incorporate the latest industry trends, tools, and methodologies. Outdated content makes students less employable and diminishes the value of the certification.

4. Equal Focus Across All Courses
The disparity in focus and placement support between courses like DAC and others such as DBDA is demoralizing for students. All courses should receive equal attention in terms of quality, resources, and placement efforts.

5. Enhanced Placement Process
C-DAC’s placement cell should strengthen its industry connections, specifically targeting companies relevant to each course’s domain. Regular communication with students about placement efforts, timelines, and progress is crucial. Transparency builds trust.

6. Hands-On Projects with Real-World Relevance
Ensure that each course has multiple, well-designed capstone projects closely aligned with industry needs. These projects should simulate real-world problems, encouraging students to apply the concepts they’ve learned.

7. Student Feedback Integration
Take student feedback seriously and act on it. When students raise concerns about course content or placement issues, address them constructively instead of dismissing or deflecting the questions. This will foster trust and a better reputation.","1. Mismatch Between Courses and Company Roles
Companies that do visit often offer roles that don’t align with the specific skillsets taught in specialized courses. For instance, students of DBDA might find themselves being considered for generic software developer roles instead of positions that utilize Big Data tools and technologies. This defeats the purpose of pursuing a specialized diploma.

2. Weak Industry Connections
The placement cell seems to lack strong relationships with companies actively hiring for niche technologies like Big Data, AI/ML, or Cloud Computing. A reputed institution like C-DAC should leverage its brand to attract top-tier companies across various domains.

3. Transparency Issues
There’s little to no communication about the placement pipeline. Students are often left guessing which companies might visit and what roles will be offered. Regular updates and transparency in the placement process are essential to keep students informed and prepared.",No,Unsatisfactory,"Yes, I would be willing to support future batches of C-DAC, but only in ways that ensure real value for the students. My experience was disappointing, and I wouldn’t want others to go through the same frustrations without improvements being made. I want future students to have an experience worth their investment, both in terms of learning and career opportunities.","1. Course Quality vs. Cost
The fees for C-DAC courses are significant, especially for students funding themselves. The quality of education and resources provided often doesn’t justify the cost. Students expect well-structured content, skilled instructors, and strong placement support for what they are paying.

2. Misaligned Course Expectations
Course names and descriptions create expectations that are often unmet. For instance, courses like DBDA should emphasize Big Data tools and technologies, but the curriculum leans heavily on Machine Learning. This not only misguides students but also reduces the marketability of their skills.

3. Poor Communication and Support
The institution lacks transparency in several areas, from placement efforts to addressing student concerns. When issues are raised, responses are defensive or dismissive, instead of offering solutions. This creates an environment of frustration and distrust.

4. Placement Dependency
Many students choose C-DAC for its placement promise, but the placement cell often underdelivers, especially for non-DAC courses. Without strong placements, the entire value proposition of the course comes into question.

Students come with high hopes, investing their time, money, and trust. If C-DAC doesn’t take active steps to improve, it risks losing credibility and relevance in the competitive education market."

However, there is room for improvement in faculty attentiveness and support, particularly at some centers like C-DAC Bangalore, to ensure a consistently excellent learning experience across all locations.","C-DAC courses are well-structured and industry-relevant, but they can further enhance their offerings by including advanced content on cloud-native technologies, DevOps practices, blockchain, and generative AI. Introducing more hands-on labs, capstone projects, and partnerships with industry leaders for live projects could also greatly improve the learning experience.

",Unsatisfactory,No,"While the C-DAC courses at the Bangalore center are well-designed and industry-relevant, there are areas that need improvement. Time management is a concern as classes often start late due to faculty delays, which impacts the overall schedule and reduces effective learning time.

Name of the course is advance computing and we don't even have proper computer lab,
one computer is being shared between 2 students and we are not even allowed to bring laptops to campus. 
They were so energetic and enthusiastic to collect all the fees from us but the response we are getting in the campus is not similar.
We DAC students have no proper classroom, Lab.
Remaining course students have also paid the same fee as us but we are the one's who's suffering here.
